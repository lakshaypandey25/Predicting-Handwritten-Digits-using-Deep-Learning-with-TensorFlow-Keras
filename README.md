This is a jupyter notebook.
The code uses MNIST dataset of handwritten digits and their corresponding values.
Tensorflow is used to predict the values. 
The accuracy of all the measurements is also measured.
One example of an image and its predicted value is also shown.
To Run this code, make sure tensorflow is installed. 
Here, I have created a Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda. 
In the terminal of the Jupyter Notebook, type-in the code: pip install tensorflow.
After tensorflow has been installed, the code is ready to be executed.
Thank You!
